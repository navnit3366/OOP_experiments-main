### Head canon for "Dean Bucks"
###
# Dean Bucks is Greendale's court-ordered settlement/reparation program to refund monies to the student body
# in response to several documented instances of illegally charged fees, exposures to chemicals known
# to be dangerous to humans, and one substantiated instance of human rights violations. 
# 
# The calculated total of damages owed to greendale students however far exceeded the city's ability pay.
# Possibly owing to this fact, the Court accepted a "re-payment plan" submitted by Greendale's Dean in which 
# the college would create it's own cryptocurrency called "Dean Bucks". Then, through largely ill-defined 
# actions in the submitted plans, would raise the value of the "Dean Bucks" coin and thus repay
# the agreeved parties many times over.
#
# The amount of Dean Bucks cryptotokens give to each student is determined by an AI reported programed by 
# the Dean, that bases the distributed amount off algorthims which again were largely ill-defined 
# before the Court accepted the plan.
#
# In addition to the initial disbursed amount, a quarterly "Deenspursal" based off token's recent value,
# is given to all students supposedly in a uniform amount.
